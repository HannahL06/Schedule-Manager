# Schedule-Manager
This program helps organise and time a user's schedule. It takes a series of tasks as input, organises them according to the user's preferences, and then are timed with a timer. The tasks and their information are added as dictionaries to a list. The user decides by entering prompts how the tasks will be ordered: either by time or difficulty, and then from greatest to least or vice-versa. Loops are used to calculate the timer. The sys library is used to update the timer on the same line. When the timer is done, the user can add more time or begin the next task.
